                <p class="article-intro">
                    ISROâ€™s first interplanetary venture, the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), or Mangalyaan, was a stunning success. Launched on November 5, 2013, it not only made India the first nation to reach Mars on its maiden attempt but also became a global symbol of cost-effective space exploration.

                <h2>Mission Objectives and Achievements</h2>
                <p>The primary objective of Mangalyaan was to demonstrate the technological capabilities required to design, plan, and execute an interplanetary mission. The mission was successfully placed into Martian orbit on September 24, 2014. It was designed for a lifespan of just six months but continued to operate for nearly eight years, a testament to ISRO's robust engineering. It provided a wealth of scientific data and over a thousand breathtaking images of the Red Planet.</p>

                <h3>Scientific Discoveries</h3>
                <p>Mangalyaan's instruments studied the Martian surface features, morphology, mineralogy, and atmosphere. The Mars Colour Camera (MCC) provided a stunning atlas of the planet, while the Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM) placed crucial upper limits on its atmospheric methane concentration, a key data point in the ongoing search for life. The mission also provided valuable insights into the atmospheric escape processes, helping scientists understand how Mars lost much of its water.</p>

                <h2>Technical Innovation and Cost-Effectiveness</h2>
                <p>Mangalyaan showcased India's innovative approach to space exploration. The mission's total cost was approximately $74 million, making it one of the most cost-effective Mars missions ever conducted. This efficiency was achieved through several innovative approaches:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gravitational Assists:</strong> The mission used Earth's gravity for acceleration, reducing fuel requirements significantly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Indigenous Technology:</strong> Most components were developed in-house, reducing costs while building domestic capabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficient Mission Planning:</strong> The mission was planned and executed in just 18 months, minimizing overhead costs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Modular Approach:</strong> The spacecraft design reused proven technologies from Chandrayaan-1, reducing development time and risk.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Mission Legacy and Impact</h2>
                <p>Mangalyaan's success had far-reaching implications for India's space program and global space exploration:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It demonstrated India's capability to conduct complex interplanetary missions.</li>
                    <li>The mission provided valuable experience in long-duration deep space mission operations.</li>
                    <li>Its success inspired a new generation of scientists and engineers in India.</li>
                    <li>The cost-effective approach became a model for other space agencies worldwide.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The spacecraft's endurance, surviving and operating for eight years against its planned six-month mission life, highlighted the robustness of ISRO's engineering. During its extended mission, Mangalyaan survived challenging periods including a long eclipse in 2017, multiple dust storms on Mars, and close encounters with Martian moons Phobos and Deimos.</p>

                <p>The mission's scientific achievements included detailed studies of the Martian atmosphere, particularly its outer layers, which provided new insights into how the planet loses its atmosphere to space. The Mars Colour Camera captured over 1,000 images, including full-disk views of Mars and its changing seasons, contributing to our understanding of Martian weather patterns and surface features.</p>
