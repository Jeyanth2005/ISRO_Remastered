                <p class="article-intro">
                    ISROâ€™s first interplanetary venture, the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), or Mangalyaan, was a stunning success. Launched on November 5, 2013, it not only made India the first nation to reach Mars on its maiden attempt but also became a global symbol of cost-effective space exploration.

                <h2>Mission Objectives and Achievements</h2>
                <p>The primary objective of Mangalyaan was to demonstrate the technological capabilities required to design, plan, and execute an interplanetary mission. The mission was successfully placed into Martian orbit on September 24, 2014. It was designed for a lifespan of just six months but continued to operate for nearly eight years, a testament to ISRO's robust engineering. It provided a wealth of scientific data and over a thousand breathtaking images of the Red Planet.</p>

                <h3>Scientific Discoveries</h3>
                <p>Mangalyaan's instruments studied the Martian surface features, morphology, mineralogy, and atmosphere. The Mars Colour Camera (MCC) provided a stunning atlas of the planet, while the Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM) placed crucial upper limits on its atmospheric methane concentration, a key data point in the ongoing search for life. The mission also provided valuable insights into the atmospheric escape processes, helping scientists understand how Mars lost much of its water.</p>
