                <p class="article-intro">
                    The Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM3), formerly known as the GSLV MkIII, is a three-stage, heavy-lift launch vehicle that represents the pinnacle of ISRO's rocketry. It is the backbone of India's self-reliance in launching heavy satellites and executing ambitious interplanetary and human spaceflight missions.

                <h2>Engineering Excellence and Cryogenic Mastery</h2>
                <p>The development of the LVM3 was driven by the need to launch heavy communication satellites into Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO) without foreign assistance. A key achievement in this journey was ISRO's mastery of cryogenic technology. The LVM3's upper stage, the CE-20, is a powerful indigenous cryogenic engine that uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as propellants. This complex technology provides high thrust and efficiency, enabling the rocket to carry massive payloads into high orbits.</p>

                <h2>Key Missions and the Future</h2>
                <p>The LVM3 has an impeccable launch record and has been the vehicle for some of ISRO's most prestigious missions, including <strong>Chandrayaan-2</strong> and the historic <strong>Chandrayaan-3</strong>. Its power and reliability demonstrated its capability for executing complex deep-space trajectories.</p>
                <p>Looking ahead, the LVM3 is set to play an even more critical role. It is the designated launch vehicle for the <strong>Gaganyaan</strong> mission, India's first human spaceflight program. The rocket is being "human-rated," which involves stringent design and testing modifications, including the integration of a crew escape system, to ensure the highest levels of safety for carrying astronauts into orbit.</p>
