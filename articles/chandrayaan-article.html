                <p class="article-intro">
                    The Chandrayaan programme, meaning "Moon-craft" in Sanskrit, is India's flagship series of lunar exploration missions. It has been pivotal in reshaping our understanding of the Moon, marking India's indelible footprint on lunar exploration from discovering water to landing on the elusive south pole.

                <h2>Chandrayaan-1: The Harbinger of Discovery</h2>
                <p>Launched on October 22, 2008, Chandrayaan-1 was India's first mission to the Moon. The mission was a resounding success, making a landmark discovery that changed lunar science forever: the confirmation of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and hydroxyl (OH) molecules on the lunar surface. This finding, confirmed by NASA's Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) payload aboard the spacecraft, fundamentally altered scientific models of the Moon's history and opened up new possibilities for future lunar habitation and resource utilization.</p>

                <h2>Chandrayaan-3: A Historic Touchdown on the South Pole</h2>
                <p>Building on the legacy of its predecessors, Chandrayaan-3 achieved a historic soft landing on the lunar south pole on August 23, 2023, making India the fourth country to land on the Moon and the first to do so in the polar region. The mission's Pragyan rover and Vikram lander were equipped with a suite of sophisticated scientific instruments to conduct in-situ analysis of the lunar surface.</p>

                <p>The mission's key findings have provided groundbreaking data. The Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) and Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) instruments confirmed the presence of Sulphur and other elements like Aluminium, Calcium, and Iron in the lunar regolith. Furthermore, the Chandraâ€™s Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) payload conducted the first-ever in-situ temperature profile of the lunar topsoil around the south pole, revealing a startlingly sharp temperature gradient. These findings are invaluable for understanding the lunar environment and planning future missions.</p>
