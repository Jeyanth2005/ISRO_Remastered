            <h2>About ISRO</h2>
            <p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the national space agency of India, operating under the Department of Space (DoS), Government of India. Headquartered in Bengaluru, ISRO is one of the world's most successful and cost-effective space agencies, known for its dedication to leveraging space technology for national development while pursuing planetary exploration and space science.</p>
            
            <h3>üöÄ Genesis and Evolution</h3>
            <h4>The Formative Years</h4>
            <p>The foundation of modern space research in India is attributed to Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, widely regarded as the father of the Indian space program. Recognizing the potential of space technology for national development, he spearheaded the establishment of the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) in 1962, under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE).</p>
            <p>Initial work began with the establishment of the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) near Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, from where sounding rockets were launched for atmospheric research, beginning in 1963.</p>
            
            <h4>Establishment of ISRO</h4>
            <p>INCOSPAR was superseded by the establishment of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on August 15, 1969. Following this, the Government of India constituted the Space Commission and established the Department of Space (DoS) in 1972, bringing ISRO under its purview.</p>
            
            <h4>Early Milestones</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First Satellite:</strong> India's first satellite, Aryabhata (named after the ancient Indian mathematician), was built by ISRO and launched on April 19, 1975, using a Soviet launch vehicle (Interkosmos).</li>
                <li><strong>Indigenous Launch:</strong> The development of the first indigenous orbital launch vehicle, the Satellite Launch Vehicle-3 (SLV-3), was a major landmark. Its first successful flight in 1980 placed the Rohini satellite into orbit, making India the seventh nation to achieve orbital launch capability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>üõ∞Ô∏è Major Programs and Systems</h3>
            <p>ISRO's activities are broadly structured around developing indigenous capabilities in three key areas: launch vehicles, satellites, and associated applications.</p>
            
            <h4>Launch Vehicles</h4>
            <p>ISRO has developed a family of reliable and versatile launch vehicles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV):</strong> The workhorse of ISRO, primarily used to launch Earth Observation and Remote Sensing satellites into Polar Sun-Synchronous Orbits (SSO). It has an excellent track record, having launched numerous Indian and foreign satellites. PSLV holds a world record for launching 104 satellites in a single mission in 2017.</li>
                <li><strong>Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV):</strong> Designed to launch heavy communication and meteorological satellites into Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO). This vehicle utilizes an indigenous Cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS) engine, a highly complex technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM3 / GSLV Mk-III):</strong> ISRO's heavy-lift launch vehicle, capable of launching heavier payloads into GTO and Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This rocket is chosen for the Gaganyaan (human spaceflight) mission.</li>
                <li><strong>Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV):</strong> A cost-effective, four-stage launch vehicle for commercial small satellite launches.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Satellite Systems</h4>
            <p>ISRO maintains one of the largest fleets of operational satellites globally, providing essential space-based services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) / GSAT Series:</strong> A series of multi-purpose geostationary satellites for telecommunications, television broadcasting, meteorology, and disaster warning.</li>
                <li><strong>Indian Remote Sensing Satellite System (IRS) / EOS Series:</strong> A series of Earth Observation satellites for resource monitoring, management, urban planning, disaster management, and environmental studies.</li>
                <li><strong>Navigation Systems:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>GPS-Aided Geo Augmented Navigation (GAGAN):</strong> A collaboration with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to provide satellite-based navigation for civil aviation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) / IRNSS:</strong> India's indigenous regional satellite navigation system, providing position, navigation, and timing services to users in India and the surrounding region.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>üåå Landmark Missions and Achievements</h3>
            <p>ISRO has carved out a unique place in the global space sector through its groundbreaking and cost-efficient planetary and scientific missions.</p>

            <h4>Lunar Missions (Chandrayaan)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chandrayaan-1 (2008):</strong> India's first mission to the Moon. The mission's Moon Impact Probe (MIP) confirmed the presence of water molecules on the lunar surface, a discovery of global scientific significance.</li>
                <li><strong>Chandrayaan-2 (2019):</strong> An ambitious mission comprising an Orbiter, Lander (Vikram), and Rover (Pragyan). While the Orbiter is fully operational, the lander soft-landing attempt failed.</li>
                <li><strong>Chandrayaan-3 (2023):</strong> A successor to Chandrayaan-2, achieving a historic soft landing on the lunar south pole on August 23, 2023. India became the fourth country to achieve a soft landing on the Moon and the first to land near the south pole.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Mars Mission</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) / Mangalyaan (2013):</strong> India's first interplanetary mission, which successfully placed a spacecraft in Mars' orbit in its very first attempt (maiden attempt). This achievement made India the fourth entity (after the US, Russia, and the EU) and the first Asian country to reach Mars.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Solar Mission</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aditya-L1 (2023-2024):</strong> India's first dedicated solar mission, successfully placed into a halo orbit around the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 1 (L1). Its primary objective is to study the Sun's corona, solar emissions, solar winds, flares, and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Space Science and Astronomy</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AstroSat (2015):</strong> India's first dedicated multi-wavelength space observatory.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Future Ambitions and Human Spaceflight</h3>
            <p>ISRO's future roadmap is defined by ambitious projects across planetary exploration and human spaceflight.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gaganyaan Mission:</strong> India's maiden human spaceflight program, aiming to send Indian astronauts (or "Vyomanauts") to Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The mission involves developing a crew module and the necessary escape systems, with an uncrewed test flight carrying a half-humanoid robot named Vyommitra planned as a precursor.</li>
                <li><strong>Bharatiya Antariksha Station (BAS):</strong> Plans are underway to establish an indigenous Indian space station by 2035, starting with an initial modular segment.</li>
                <li><strong>Interplanetary Missions:</strong> Future plans include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mangalyaan-2 (Mars Lander Mission):</strong> A follow-up mission to Mars, potentially including a lander, rover, and even a helicopter.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shukrayaan-1 (Venus Orbiter Mission):</strong> A mission to study the atmosphere and surface of Venus.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lunar Polar Exploration Mission (LUPEX):</strong> A joint mission with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to explore the Moon's polar region.</li>
                    </ul>
