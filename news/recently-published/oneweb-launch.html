                <p><strong>In a significant commercial achievement, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is set to launch 36 satellites for the UK-based broadband communications company, OneWeb.</strong> The launch will be executed by ISRO's heavy-lift LVM3 rocket from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota.</p>
                <p>This mission marks the second time ISRO is launching satellites for OneWeb, further strengthening the partnership between the two entities and highlighting ISRO's growing prominence in the global commercial launch market. The LVM3 rocket will deploy the satellites into a precise Low Earth Orbit (LEO), adding to OneWeb's constellation that aims to provide high-speed, low-latency internet access worldwide.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "This collaboration with OneWeb is a testament to the reliability and cost-effectiveness of our launch services. The successful execution of this mission will be another proud moment for India and will reinforce the world's confidence in our capabilities."
                    <cite>- Chairman, ISRO</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p>The successful integration and launch of a large number of satellites in a single mission require complex orbital maneuvering and deployment strategies. This launch will once again demonstrate the technical expertise of ISRO's launch teams and the robustness of the LVM3 vehicle.</p>
