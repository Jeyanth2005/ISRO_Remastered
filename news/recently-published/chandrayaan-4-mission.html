                <p><strong>Building on the monumental success of its Chandrayaan-3 mission, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has officially announced its next lunar endeavour: Chandrayaan-4.</strong> This highly ambitious mission will aim to perform a soft landing on the Moon, collect samples of lunar rock and soil, and return them to Earth for detailed scientific analysis.</p>
                <p>The mission will be a significant leap in India's planetary exploration capabilities, involving complex technologies such as robotic sample collection, ascent from the lunar surface, and a high-velocity re-entry and recovery of the sample capsule. The Chandrayaan-4 mission is envisioned as a multi-module spacecraft, likely consisting of a lander, an ascent vehicle, and a transfer module to bring the precious cargo back to Earth.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Returning samples from the Moon is a complex technological challenge that very few nations have mastered. With Chandrayaan-4, we are not just exploring the Moon, but we are also pushing the boundaries of our own technological capabilities. The scientific payoff from analyzing these pristine lunar samples back on Earth will be immense."
                    <cite>- Chairman, ISRO</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Analyzing lunar samples directly in terrestrial laboratories will allow scientists to use sophisticated equipment that cannot be sent to space, providing unprecedented insights into the Moon's origin, evolution, and resource potential. The mission is currently in the preliminary planning stages, with a launch targeted for the late 2020s.</p>
