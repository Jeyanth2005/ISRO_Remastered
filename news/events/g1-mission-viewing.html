                <p><strong>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is thrilled to invite the public to witness a historic milestone in India's space journey.</strong> The Launch View Gallery at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, will be open for the public to watch the launch of the first uncrewed test flight of the Gaganyaan mission (G1).</p>
                <p>This is a unique opportunity for space enthusiasts to experience the thunderous roar and majestic sight of the human-rated LVM3 rocket as it lifts off, carrying the Gaganyaan orbital module on its first journey to space. The G1 mission is a critical test of the launch vehicle, the crew module's systems, and the re-entry and recovery operations, paving the way for India's first human spaceflight.</p>
