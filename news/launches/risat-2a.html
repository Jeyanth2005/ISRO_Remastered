                <p><strong>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is preparing for the launch of RISAT-2A, an advanced radar imaging satellite, in early 2026.</strong> The satellite will be launched aboard the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota.</p>
                <p>RISAT-2A is equipped with a state-of-the-art Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument. SAR technology is unique in its ability to penetrate cloud cover and operate during both day and night, providing reliable and high-resolution imagery regardless of weather conditions. This capability is vital for a wide range of applications.</p>

                <h3>Mission Objectives:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Disaster Management:</strong> To provide crucial imagery for monitoring floods, cyclones, and landslides, enabling faster and more effective response.</li>
                    <li><strong>Agriculture and Forestry:</strong> To monitor crop health, assess forest cover, and track changes in land use.</li>
                    <li><strong>National Security:</strong> To enhance the nation's surveillance capabilities for security and strategic purposes.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The RISAT series of satellites has become a cornerstone of India's Earth observation programme. The addition of RISAT-2A to the constellation will ensure the continuity and enhancement of these critical all-weather observation services for the nation.</p>
