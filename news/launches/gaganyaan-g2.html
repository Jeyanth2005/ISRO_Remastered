            <p class="article-dateline">Scheduled Launch: Mid-2026</p>
            
            <div class="article-body">
                <p><strong>Following the first developmental flight, ISRO is targeting mid-2026 for the second uncrewed test flight of the Gaganyaan mission, designated G2.</strong> This crucial mission will feature the humanoid robot 'Vyommitra' as a passenger, marking the final major test before India's first crewed spaceflight.</p>
                <p>The G2 mission will be launched on the human-rated LVM3 vehicle and will closely simulate a crewed mission. The objective is to validate the entire mission profile, from launch to orbit, re-entry, and landing, with a life-like passenger on board. Vyommitra, which translates from Sanskrit as "space friend," is a sophisticated humanoid robot designed and built by ISRO.</p>

                <h3>Vyommitra's Role in the G2 Mission:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Simulating Human Functions:</strong> Vyommitra will mimic human crew activities, such as operating switch panels and monitoring crew module parameters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> The humanoid is equipped with sensors to measure and transmit vital data on the conditions inside the crew capsule, including vibration, acoustic levels, and radiation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Life Support System Interaction:</strong> It will interact with the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) to test its performance in a simulated crewed scenario.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The data collected by Vyommitra will be invaluable for assessing the safety and readiness of the Gaganyaan spacecraft's systems, ensuring that the environment inside the crew module is perfectly safe for the astronauts on the subsequent historic flight.</p>
