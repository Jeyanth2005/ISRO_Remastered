                <p><strong>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully launched the PSLV-C57 vehicle carrying the Aditya-L1 satellite, India's first solar observatory, from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR, Sriharikota.</strong> The launch took place at 11:50 AM IST.</p>
                <p>After a flight of 63 minutes and 20 seconds, the satellite was successfully injected into an elliptical orbit of 235x19500 km around the Earth. The satellite is functioning normally and will now undergo a series of orbit-raising maneuvers before it is placed in its final halo orbit around the Lagrange point 1 (L1) of the Sun-Earth system.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "This is a landmark achievement for Indian science and our space program. Aditya-L1 will provide us with an unprecedented view of the Sun and help us understand its dynamics in a way that has never been possible before."
                    <cite>- Chairman, ISRO</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p>The Aditya-L1 mission carries seven scientific payloads to systematically study the Sun's corona, photosphere, chromosphere, and solar wind. The data from this mission is expected to provide crucial insights into space weather and its impact on Earth.</p>
