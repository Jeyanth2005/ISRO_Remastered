                <p><strong>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) today announced the selection of a new batch of astronaut trainees who will join the ambitious Gaganyaan programme.</strong> This development marks a significant expansion of India's human spaceflight corps, underscoring the nation's long-term commitment to sending its citizens to space.</p>
                <p>The newly selected candidates, whose identities are yet to be revealed, have been chosen after a rigorous, multi-level selection process that tested their physical fitness, psychological resilience, and technical aptitude. They will join the first batch of four astronaut-designates who are already in advanced stages of their training. The new trainees will now embark on a comprehensive training regimen that includes academic coursework, physical conditioning, and training in specialized simulators to prepare them for the challenges of spaceflight.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Expanding our astronaut pool is a crucial step in ensuring the sustainability of our human spaceflight programme. While the first Gaganyaan mission is our immediate priority, we are also laying the groundwork for future, more complex missions, including the establishment of an Indian space station."
                    <cite>- Chairman, ISRO</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p>The training will be conducted at ISRO's Astronaut Training Facility in Bengaluru and will also involve collaboration with international space agencies. This strategic move to enlarge the astronaut cadre is aligned with ISRO's vision of creating a sustained human presence in space and undertaking long-duration missions in the coming decade.</p>
