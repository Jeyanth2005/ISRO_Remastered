                <p><strong>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has officially announced the schedule for the first uncrewed flight test of its prestigious Gaganyaan programme, marking a significant step towards India's maiden human spaceflight mission.</strong> The test is slated to take place in the final quarter of 2025 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota.</p>
                <p>This mission, designated 'G1', will be a crucial trial for the entire launch system. It will involve launching the Gaganyaan orbital module into a Low Earth Orbit, performing a series of in-orbit maneuvers, and executing a safe re-entry and splashdown in the Bay of Bengal. The primary objective is to validate the performance of the human-rated LVM3 launch vehicle, the life support systems, and the crucial deceleration systems, including the parachutes.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "The G1 mission is the crucible where we test our technologies before we commit to sending our astronauts. Every system, from the launch vehicle to the crew module's heat shield, will be rigorously evaluated. This flight is for all intents and purposes a full dress rehearsal without our Gaganyatris."
                    <cite>- Chairman, ISRO</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p>The crew module for this uncrewed flight will be equipped with a humanoid robot, 'Vyommitra', to simulate human functions and collect vital data on the conditions inside the capsule, such as vibration, radiation, and microgravity effects. This data will be invaluable for ensuring the safety and well-being of the astronauts on the subsequent crewed mission.</p>
