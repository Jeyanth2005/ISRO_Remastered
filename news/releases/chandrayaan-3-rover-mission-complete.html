                <p><strong>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has confirmed that the Pragyan rover from the historic Chandrayaan-3 mission has successfully completed all its assigned scientific tasks on the lunar surface.</strong> The rover has now been set into a safe 'sleep mode' ahead of the impending lunar night.</p>
                <p>During its operational phase of one lunar day (equivalent to about 14 Earth days), the six-wheeled, solar-powered rover traversed over 100 meters on the Moon's south polar region. It conducted a series of in-situ experiments that have yielded invaluable data about the elemental and chemical composition of the lunar soil and rocks. The Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) payloads on the rover have confirmed the presence of Sulphur, Aluminium, Calcium, Iron, and other elements near the landing site.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "The Pragyan rover has performed flawlessly and exceeded our expectations. The scientific data it has collected is a treasure trove for lunar scientists worldwide. We have put the rover into sleep mode, and while its awakening is not guaranteed, we remain hopeful that it will power up again at the next lunar sunrise."
                    <cite>- Chairman, ISRO</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p>With the lunar night setting in, temperatures at the south pole are expected to plummet to below -200 degrees Celsius. The rover's electronic systems are not designed to withstand such extreme cold. However, ISRO engineers have oriented the rover's solar panel to receive sunlight at the next sunrise, scheduled for late December. The data collected by both the Pragyan rover and the Vikram lander is being analyzed by ISRO's science teams, and further findings will be shared with the global scientific community in the coming months.</p>
