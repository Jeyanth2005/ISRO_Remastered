                <p><strong>Greetings from ISRO, and welcome to the August 2025 edition of Orbital Outlook.</strong> This month, our focus was on the final preparations for a key scientific mission and the continuous training of our Gaganyaan astronauts.</p>

                <h3>Final Preparations for Aditya-L1</h3>
                <p>The month of August was buzzing with activity at the U R Rao Satellite Centre, where Aditya-L1, India's first solar observatory, underwent its final space-simulation tests. The spacecraft's seven scientific payloads were integrated and tested for performance in a vacuum and extreme temperatures. These rigorous tests ensure that the satellite will operate flawlessly once it reaches its destination at the Sun-Earth L1 point.</p>
                
                <h3>Gaganyaan Astronauts Begin Advanced Simulator Training</h3>
                <p>The four astronaut-designates for the Gaganyaan mission have entered a new phase of their training. They are now undergoing extensive sessions in the advanced Gaganyaan Mission Simulator at the Astronaut Training Facility in Bengaluru. This simulator realistically mimics the conditions of launch, orbital flight, and re-entry, preparing the crew for every phase of their historic journey.</p>

                <h3>Spotlight on Earth Observation</h3>
                <p>Data from our constellation of Earth observation satellites played a crucial role in disaster management this month, providing real-time imagery for flood monitoring in several states. The high-resolution data helped authorities in planning and executing effective relief operations. This continues to be a prime example of how ISRO's space technology directly benefits the nation.</p>
