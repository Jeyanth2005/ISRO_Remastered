                <p><strong>Welcome to the July 2025 edition of Frontier Focus.</strong> This month, we highlight a major milestone in our propulsion technology and share insights from the Chandrayaan-3 science team.</p>
                
                <h3>Successful Test of New Semi-Cryogenic Engine</h3>
                <p>ISRO achieved a significant breakthrough with the successful long-duration test of its new semi-cryogenic engine. The engine, which uses refined kerosene (ISROSENE) as fuel and liquid oxygen as an oxidizer, was tested for over 800 seconds at our propulsion complex in Mahendragiri. This powerful and efficient engine is a critical building block for our Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV), which will be capable of lifting much heavier payloads into orbit.</p>

                <h3>An Interview with the Chandrayaan-3 Science Team</h3>
                <p>In a special feature this month, we sat down with the lead scientists from the Chandrayaan-3 mission. They shared their experiences analyzing the data sent back by the Vikram lander and Pragyan rover. The team discussed the groundbreaking confirmation of Sulphur on the lunar surface and the ongoing analysis of the unique thermal profile of the lunar south pole, highlighting how these findings are reshaping our understanding of the Moon.</p>
                
                <h3>Upcoming Events for Space Enthusiasts</h3>
                <p>Mark your calendars! ISRO will be hosting its annual World Space Week celebrations from October 4th to 10th. Events, including public lectures, exhibitions, and model rocketry competitions, will be held at various ISRO centres across the country. Stay tuned to our website for more details on how you can participate.</p>
