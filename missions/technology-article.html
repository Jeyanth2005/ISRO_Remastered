                <h2>1. Launch Vehicle Systems: The Pillars of India's Space Access</h2>
                <p>ISRO's prowess is fundamentally rooted in its diverse and highly reliable fleet of launch vehicles. Each vehicle is a product of decades of technological refinement, designed to cater to a specific range of payloads and orbital requirements.</p>

                <h3>The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV): The Unwavering Workhorse</h3>
                <p>The PSLV is arguably ISRO's most significant technological achievement. It is a four-stage launch vehicle that has earned a reputation for its reliability and versatility. The first and third stages are powered by solid rocket motors, providing high thrust at liftoff and in the upper atmosphere. The second and fourth stages are liquid-fueled, allowing for precise control and maneuvering. This unique configuration makes the PSLV highly adaptable for launching a variety of satellites into different orbits, particularly the Sun-Synchronous Polar Orbit (SSPO), which is ideal for remote sensing and Earth observation missions.</p>
                <h4>Technology Highlights:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strap-On Boosters:</strong> The PSLV can be configured with different numbers of solid strap-on motors (up to six) to increase its payload capacity, a modular design that enhances flexibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vikas Engine:</strong> The second stage of the PSLV utilizes the Vikas engine, a liquid-fueled rocket engine derived from French technology, which has been indigenously perfected and now serves as a key component in multiple launch vehicles.</li>
