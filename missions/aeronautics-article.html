                <p class="article-intro">
                    The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is at the forefront of a global effort to revolutionize space access by focusing on reusable launch vehicle (RLV) technology. By developing winged, autonomous vehicles that can return to Earth like an aircraft, ISRO aims to make space more accessible and sustainable for the future.

                <h2>The Reusable Launch Vehicle â€“ Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD) Program</h2>
                <p>The RLV-TD program is ISRO's most ambitious aeronautical initiative, aimed at creating a two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) RLV. The RLV-TD, named "Pushpak," is a scaled-down prototype that serves as a flying testbed for a series of critical technology demonstrations.</p>
                
                <h3>Hypersonic Flight Experiment (HEX)</h3>
                <p>The first step was the HEX mission, successfully conducted on May 23, 2016. The vehicle was launched atop a solid rocket booster, reaching an altitude of approximately 65 km. It glided back to Earth at hypersonic speeds (Mach 5), validating its aerodynamic design and Thermal Protection System during a high-velocity re-entry.</p>
                
                <h3>Landing Experiment (LEX)</h3>
                <p>The LEX missions are the most critical phase, designed to demonstrate the RLV's ability to perform an autonomous, unpowered landing on a runway. For these tests, the RLV-TD is carried to a predetermined altitude by a helicopter and released.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>RLV-LEX-01 (April 2, 2023):</strong> A landmark achievement where the RLV was released from 4.5 km altitude and landed precisely on the runway at the Aeronautical Test Range (ATR) in Chitradurga.</li>
                    <li><strong>RLV-LEX-02 (March 22, 2024):</strong> This test successfully demonstrated the system's robustness by handling more challenging "off-nominal" release conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>RLV-LEX-03 (June 23, 2024):</strong> The final test validated new technologies and proved mastery of the terminal phase of autonomous landing.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Scramjet Engine Technology Demonstrator</h2>
                <p>Simultaneously, ISRO is developing advanced air-breathing propulsion systems like the scramjet engine. Unlike a conventional rocket that carries its own oxidizer, an air-breathing engine takes oxygen directly from the atmosphere, significantly reducing the launch vehicle's weight and cost.</p>
                <p>ISRO's first Scramjet Engine Technology Demonstrator mission was a success on August 28, 2016. A sounding rocket carried two scramjet engines, which ignited and operated for about five seconds at a hypersonic speed of Mach 6. This test placed India in an elite group of nations to have successfully flight-tested a scramjet engine.</p>

                <h2>The Future: From Demonstrators to Operational Systems</h2>
                <p>The successful completion of these aeronautical missions lays the groundwork for ISRO's future space endeavors. The ultimate goal is to develop the Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV), a partially reusable rocket with a recoverable first stage. The data and technologies proven through the RLV-TD and scramjet programs will be directly applied to this new vehicle.</p>
                <p>This strategic focus on reusable technology is not just about cost-cutting; it's about building a sustainable and resilient space program that can support India's growing ambitions in space exploration and commercial satellite launching. By mastering these complex aeronautical and propulsion technologies, ISRO is cementing its position as a key player in the global space industry.</p>
